  "descriptionPlain": "Hi 👋🏾 I'm Abhik https://www.linkedin.com/in/abhikpramanik, Ashby's Co-Founder and VP of Engineering. We're looking for an ambitious full-stack engineer who is laser-focused on solving customer problems and making the right long-term investments to solve them not only today but in our future features and products.\n\nIf you've seen this role posted before, it's because we're always looking for incredible engineering talent to help build the future of Ashby, as we more than double our business year over year. But we're not just collecting resumes:\n\n - So far we've hired 10 Product Engineers in 2025 (that's a 20% increase in our total engineering headcount from this one role in the first 4 months!)\n\n - We aim to respond to applicants within 3-4 days (often quicker)\n\nWhat Ashby gives you in return is the best of both early and growth-stage environments. The agency and no-nonsense of a seed startup: you write product specs, make product and design decisions, and build in an almost-no-meeting culture. While also the product-market fit and scale of a growth-stage startup: thousands of daily users who depend on your software and eagerly await your next feature. \n\nWe have notable customers like Notion, Linear, Shopify, and Snowflake. Our growth and retention metrics are best-in-class among our peers: we have tens of millions in ARR, growing >100% year over year, very low churn, and many years of runway. We'll share more details once we meet.\n\nYou're not afraid to tackle any part of a technology stack. You do what's necessary to successfully deliver a feature, whether writing frontend or choosing new infrastructure. We'll provide a supportive environment to do it successfully (e.g., design system, SRE team).\n\nYou've tackled projects with a lot of product and technical ambiguity, and you thrive at the intersection of the two. We're not building a simple CRUD app, and many of the challenges we tackle require you to use your knowledge of our customers to build powerful abstractions and flexibility in the system to solve a class of problems.\n\nYou know how to strike the right balance between speed and quality. Ashby wasn't built quickly. We took four years to launch publicly because convincing customers to switch required a high-quality product. However, time isn't infinite, especially for a startup, so we still move with urgency—we've built the equivalent of three or more VC-backed startups with a very small team.\n\nYou are ambitious and always looking to improve your skills. For most engineers, this role will give you more freedom and responsibilities than you've experienced in the past. To thrive (and level up), you'll need to be open to feedback (and we give lots of it).\n\nYou're an excellent collaborator and communicator. Ownership and freedom don't mean you work in a vacuum. You'll need to vet your decisions with the appropriate stakeholders, keep them up to date when necessary, and work with other engineers to get your projects across the finish line. Clear and concise communication helps a lot here!",
