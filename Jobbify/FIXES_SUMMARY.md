# 🎉 Issues Fixed & Algorithm Enhanced

## Summary
All errors and warnings have been successfully resolved, and the job recommendation algorithm has been significantly enhanced from v1.0 to v1.1.

## ✅ Issues Fixed

### 1. Metro Bundler Warning
**Issue**: `Unknown option "symbolicate" with value {"customizeFrame": [Function customizeFrame]} was found. Did you mean "symbolicator"?`

**Fix**: Updated `metro.config.js` to use the correct `symbolicator` option instead of `symbolicate`.

**File**: `metro.config.js`
```javascript
// Before
config.symbolicate = {
  customizeFrame: () => null
};

// After  
config.symbolicator = {
  customizeFrame: () => null
};
```

### 2. Package Version Compatibility
**Issue**: `expo-google-app-auth@10.0.0 - expected version: ~8.3.0`

**Fix**: Updated package.json to use the compatible version.

**File**: `package.json`
```json
// Before
"expo-google-app-auth": "^10.0.0"

// After
"expo-google-app-auth": "~8.3.0"
```

### 3. Database Table Missing
**Issue**: `Error fetching user job preferences: {"code": "42P01", "details": null, "hint": null, "message": "relation \"public.user_job_preferences\" does not exist"}`

**Fix**: Created the `user_job_preferences` table in Supabase with proper schema and RLS policies.

**Database Schema**: Complete table with 23 columns including:
- Location preferences (preferred_locations, remote_work_preference, etc.)
- Job type preferences (preferred_job_types, preferred_industries, etc.)
- Experience and role preferences (experience_level, preferred_roles, etc.)
- Compensation preferences (min_salary, max_salary, etc.)
- Algorithm weights (location_weight, salary_weight, etc.)
- Learning preferences (auto_learn_from_swipes)

**RLS Policies**: Proper data isolation ensuring users can only access their own preferences.

## 🚀 Algorithm Enhancements (v1.0 → v1.1)

### Enhanced Location Scoring
- **Better Remote Detection**: Now recognizes "WFH", "work from home", "anywhere" in addition to "remote"
- **Fuzzy Location Matching**: Handles variations like "San Francisco" ↔ "San Fran" ↔ "Bay Area"
- **Improved City/State Matching**: Better parsing of "City, State" format
- **Partial Word Matching**: Matches partial location names intelligently

### Enhanced Role Scoring  
- **Abbreviation Handling**: Understands "dev" ↔ "developer", "eng" ↔ "engineer", etc.
- **Experience Level Detection**: Matches jobs based on seniority keywords
- **Better Tag Analysis**: More sophisticated matching of job tags with preferences
- **Weighted Scoring**: Multiple match types with different weights

### Improved Overall Algorithm
- **Better Error Handling**: More robust fallback mechanisms
- **Enhanced Scoring**: More nuanced scoring with better weight distribution
- **Detailed Breakdowns**: Better recommendation reasons and score explanations
- **Optimized Thresholds**: Lowered minimum score (40 → 35) for better coverage

## 📊 Test Results
