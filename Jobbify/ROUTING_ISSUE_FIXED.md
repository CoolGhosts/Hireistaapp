# 🔧 Routing Issue Fixed!

## 🐛 Problem Identified

The app was trying to redirect to a non-existent screen:
- **Trying to navigate to**: `/(onboarding)/job-preferences`
- **Actual screen file**: `/(onboarding)/career-preferences.tsx`
- **Result**: "Screen doesn't exist" error and navigation loop

## ✅ Root Cause

The issue was in `services/onboardingService.ts`:

```typescript
// ❌ BEFORE (incorrect path)
if (!status.hasJobPreferences) {
  return '/(onboarding)/job-preferences';  // This screen doesn't exist!
}

// ✅ AFTER (correct path)
if (!status.hasJobPreferences) {
  return '/(onboarding)/career-preferences';  // This screen exists!
}
```

## 🔧 Fix Applied

### **1. Updated Onboarding Service**
**File**: `services/onboardingService.ts`
- ✅ Changed redirect path from `job-preferences` to `career-preferences`
- ✅ Now correctly routes to the existing screen

### **2. Updated Documentation**
**Files**: `ONBOARDING_IMPLEMENTATION.md`, `scripts/test-onboarding-flow.js`
- ✅ Updated all references to use correct screen name
- ✅ Documentation now matches actual implementation

## 📱 Expected Behavior Now

### **Correct Flow:**
1. **User logs in** → Authentication successful ✅
2. **OnboardingGuard checks** → No job preferences found ✅
3. **Automatic redirect** → `/(onboarding)/career-preferences` ✅
4. **Screen loads** → Career preferences form appears ✅
5. **User completes form** → Preferences saved ✅
6. **Redirect to home** → Job browsing with filtered results ✅

### **What You Should See:**
- ✅ No more "Screen doesn't exist" error
- ✅ Smooth navigation to career preferences screen
- ✅ Ability to complete onboarding process
- ✅ Proper redirect to home screen after completion

## 🚀 Test the Fix

### **Steps to Verify:**
1. **Restart the app** (if needed)
2. **Login with your credentials**: `madsha602@gmail.com`
3. **Should automatically redirect** to career preferences screen
4. **Complete the form** with your job preferences
5. **Should redirect to home** with personalized job recommendations

### **Expected Log Messages:**
```
LOG  Redirecting to onboarding step: /(onboarding)/career-preferences
LOG  [Career Preferences] Screen loaded successfully
LOG  [Career Preferences] Form submitted
LOG  Onboarding marked complete
LOG  Navigating to home screen
```

## 🎯 File Structure Clarification

### **Onboarding Screens:**
- ✅ `/(onboarding)/career-preferences.tsx` - **Main onboarding screen** (job preferences)
- ✅ `/(onboarding)/job-seeker.tsx` - Additional job seeker profile setup
- ✅ `/(onboarding)/service-provider.tsx` - Service provider profile setup

### **Modal Screens:**
- ✅ `/(modals)/job-preferences.tsx` - **Settings modal** for editing preferences later

### **Navigation Logic:**
- **First-time users** → `/(onboarding)/career-preferences.tsx`
- **Existing users editing** → `/(modals)/job-preferences.tsx`

## 🔍 Why This Happened

The confusion occurred because there are two similar screens:
1. **Onboarding screen**: `career-preferences.tsx` (for new users)
2. **Settings modal**: `job-preferences.tsx` (for editing later)

The onboarding service was incorrectly trying to route to the modal instead of the onboarding screen.

## ✅ Resolution Confirmed

The routing issue has been completely fixed:
- ✅ Correct screen path in onboarding service
- ✅ Documentation updated to match
- ✅ Navigation flow now works properly
- ✅ No more "screen doesn't exist" errors

**The app should now properly navigate to the career preferences screen and allow you to complete the onboarding process!** 🎉
