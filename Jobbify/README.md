## Ashby Integration

The app now supports fetching jobs directly from Ashby-hosted job boards. This integration allows companies using Ashby to display their job postings in the app.

### Setup Ashby Integration

1. **Find your job board name**: Go to your Ashby job board URL (e.g., `https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/YourCompany`) and note the company name in the URL.

2. **Configure in the app**:
   - Open the app and go to Profile â†’ Ashby Job Board
   - Enter your job board name
   - Choose whether to include compensation data
   - Save the configuration

3. **Alternative configuration**: You can also set it statically in `app.config.js`:
   ```javascript
   extra: {
     ASHBY_JOB_BOARD_NAME: "YourCompanyName",
     ASHBY_INCLUDE_COMPENSATION: "true",
   }
   ```

### Features
- Fetches jobs with detailed compensation data
- Automatically maps Ashby job fields to app format
- Extracts qualifications and requirements from job descriptions
- Supports remote job indicators
- Graceful fallback when Ashby API is unavailable
