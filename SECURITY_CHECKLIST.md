## ‚úÖ Completed Security Measures

### 1. Removed Hardcoded API Keys
- ‚úÖ Removed hardcoded RapidAPI key from `JobsService.ts` and `rapidApiJobsService.ts`
- ‚úÖ Removed hardcoded Supabase keys from test files
- ‚úÖ Updated all services to use environment variables

### 2. Cleaned Up Test Data
- ‚úÖ Removed hardcoded test user IDs from scripts
- ‚úÖ Verified no test accounts exist in Supabase profiles table
- ‚úÖ Verified no test data exists in job_cache table

- ‚úÖ No local credential storage beyond Supabase's secure storage adapter
- ‚úÖ Proper session management with automatic token refresh

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Warnings Addressed

### Previously Found Issues (Now Fixed):
1. **RapidAPI Key Exposure**: Was hardcoded in client-side code
   - **Fixed**: Now uses environment variables
   
2. **Google Client IDs**: Were hardcoded in multiple files
   - **Fixed**: Now configurable via environment variables
   
3. **Test User Data**: Hardcoded UUIDs in test scripts
   - **Fixed**: Removed hardcoded values, added placeholders

4. **Supabase Keys in Tests**: Anon keys hardcoded in test files
   - **Fixed**: Now use environment variables with fallbacks

## üìã Next Steps for Production

### Required Environment Variables:
```bash
# Essential for production
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_production_supabase_url
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_production_anon_key

# Required for job fetching
EXPO_PUBLIC_RAPIDAPI_KEY=your_rapidapi_key

# Required for Google OAuth
EXPO_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_WEB_CLIENT_ID=your_google_web_client_id
EXPO_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_IOS_CLIENT_ID=your_google_ios_client_id

# Optional AI features
EXPO_PUBLIC_OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_key
EXPO_PUBLIC_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
```

### Supabase Storage Setup:
1. Create `resumes` bucket in Supabase Storage
2. Configure bucket policies for user file access
3. Set up file upload size limits

### Production Deployment:
1. Ensure all environment variables are set in production
2. Verify RLS policies are working correctly
3. Test authentication flows in production environment
4. Monitor API usage and set up billing alerts
